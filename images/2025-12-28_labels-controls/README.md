# Label & Controls Photo Documentation (Dec 28, 2025)

## Purpose
This folder provides photo documentation to ensure **sample traceability** and establish **baseline controls** for qualitative comparison in the HCMUS fishpond water quality project.

## What is included
### 1) Sample lineup (Round 2)
- Group/lineup photos showing multiple bottles in the same frame for consistent visual comparison.

### 2) Label close-ups (Traceability)
- Close-up images of handwritten labels to verify:
  - sample IDs (e.g., S01–S09)
  - date/time annotations
  - grouping and labeling consistency across samples

### 3) Control references (Baseline)
- **Blank container control (BCEM_CTR)**: an empty/clean container reference to confirm the appearance of the container itself.
- **Tap-water control (BCEM_TW0)**: a tap-water reference (no filter) used as a baseline for clarity and background coloration.

## How to use these materials
- Use lineup photos for a fast side-by-side qualitative comparison (clarity, color, sediment visibility).
- Use label close-ups to cross-check sample identity when interpreting measurements or other media.
- Use control references (BCEM_CTR, BCEM_TW0) as baselines when describing “clear” vs “turbid” visual conditions.

## Notes
- Photos are intended for **documentation and reproducibility**, not as quantitative measurements.
- Any interpretation should be paired with the measurement dataset in `data/measurements/`.
