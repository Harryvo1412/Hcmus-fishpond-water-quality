# Pilot Fieldwork – Final Session: Sampling & In-Situ Measurements (Rounds 1–3)
**Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Location:** HCMUS Fishpond  
**Session:** Pilot fieldwork (Final session of the pilot series)  
**Samples:** Sample07–Sample09  
**Rounds:** Round 1, Round 2, Round 3 (R1–R3)

## Why this folder matters (Final pilot validation)
This folder documents the **final pilot session**, designed to:
1) complete the three-batch pilot coverage (S01–03, S04–06, S07–09),
2) provide the most complete **traceability evidence** (sampling → labeling → measurement),
3) serve as the **closing validation set** before downstream analysis/reporting.

## Evidence included (End-to-end traceability)
### A) Field sampling & labeling
- Pre-sampling / empty-bottle preparation photos (as applicable)
- Label-at-collection images for Sample07–Sample09
- Sampling site overview images for environmental context

### B) Sample overview
- `all_samples_overview` photos showing multiple bottles in a single frame to support consistent qualitative comparison.

### C) Measurement evidence (R1–R3)
For each sample (Sample07–Sample09), device-screen photos document:
- **pH** readings across Round 1–3
- **EC/Temperature** readings across Round 1–3

## How to use these materials
- Use label-at-collection photos to confirm sample identity when reviewing measurement logs.
- Use device-screen photos as **verification evidence** (not the primary numeric record).
- Use overview/site photos to support contextual interpretation alongside the measurement dataset.

## QA / Notes
- Photos are archived to support **reproducibility and transparency**.
- Official numeric records are maintained in `data/measurements/`.
