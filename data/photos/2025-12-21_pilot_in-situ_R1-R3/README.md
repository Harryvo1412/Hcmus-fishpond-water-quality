# Pilot Fieldwork – Sampling & In-Situ Measurements (Rounds 1–3)
**Date:** 2025-12-21  
**Location:** HCMUS Fishpond  
**Session:** Pilot sampling + in-situ measurements (Session 2)  
**Samples:** Sample04–Sample06  
**Rounds:** Round 1, Round 2, Round 3 (R1–R3)

## Purpose
This folder documents the **second pilot fieldwork session** of the HCMUS fishpond water quality project. The photos provide traceable evidence of sampling, labeling, context observations, and in-situ measurements across three repeated rounds.

## Contents
### A) Field sampling, labeling, and context observations
- Sampling at pond + labeled-at-collection photos for traceability
- Empty bottle / preparation photos (as applicable)
- Overview images of all samples in the same frame
- Context observation photos (e.g., foam/visible surface conditions, area survey)

### B) Measurement evidence (R1–R3)
For each sample (Sample04–Sample06), device-screen photos document:
- **pH**: `...pH_Round1`, `...pH_Round2`, `...pH_Round3`
- **EC/Temperature**: `...EC-Temp_Round1`, `...EC-Temp_Round2`, `...EC-Temp_Round3`

## QA / Notes
- Photos are for documentation (traceability + reproducibility). Numeric values are recorded in the dataset file.
- Some images capture qualitative observations (foam/surface conditions) and should be interpreted alongside measurements.
