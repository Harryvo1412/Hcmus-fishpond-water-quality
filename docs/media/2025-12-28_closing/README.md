# Project Closing Documentation (Dec 28, 2025)

## Purpose
This folder contains the **closing documentation** of the HCMUS fishpond water quality pilot project. The images serve as a final visual record for reporting and project archiving.

## Contents
- **Closing Pyramid (Front / Label Side):** final arrangement of sample bottles used as an end-of-project visual summary.
- **Special Shot (Day 16 – 23:09):** timestamped closing frame for project milestone archiving.

## Notes
- These images are intended for **presentation and archival narrative**, not for in-situ measurement verification.
- Related pilot sessions (raw fieldwork evidence) are stored under `data/photos/` by date.
